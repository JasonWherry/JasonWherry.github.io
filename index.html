              <p class="display-6 text-black">I am a 2020 Graduate of Ohio University with a Bachelor's degree in <b>Computer Science</b>. I commonly use the following technologies when working on personal projects: Python3, C++, Bash, GitHub, SQL, HTML5/CSS3, and JavaScript. Sublime Text 3 is my text editor of choice.

          <h2 class="display-5 text-black">Application Developer Intern ~ Parmetech, Inc.</h2>
          <p class="display-6 text-black">Summer of exposure to the development process of an internal web-application on a small scale system. Created HTML5/CSS3 web pages to host on an internal printer network. Primarily used JavaScript/jQuery for front-end development functionality, occasionally employing Python for other scripting purposes.

          <h2 class="display-5 text-black">Controls Engineering Intern ~ Fori Automation</h2>
          <p class="display-6 text-black">Worked 3 months as a full-time intern gaining knowledge and insight on industrial automation. Operated from various engineering drawings and verbal instructions to meet schedule requirements. Electrical assembly of various cells/kits was my main task; To do so, I used a wide range of hand & power tools. My time at Fori taight me so much because it was an alien environment for me, a Computer Scientist. I satrted to view the entire picture of a project, helping me  undertand what is physically possible to build and implement with software.

          <h2 class="display-5 text-black">CS Engineering Ambassador ~ Ohio University</h2>
          <p class="display-6 text-black">I acted as a Russ College liaison, handling prospective students and parents who seek more information about our Engineering programs. Additionally, I promoted the Russ College of Engineering and Technology and networked with Ohio University Alumni. My favorite part of Engineering Ambassadors was assisting the surrounding community through community service events.
          <br><br>
          Day-to-day, I gave tours of the Russ college and answered questions centered around Computer science and Electrical Engineering. Leading tours helped me value the impact one can make in a short period of time. The aspirations of soon-to-be college students was very motivating! Their youth naturally produced optimism & curiosity, two facets essential for innovation. Being in this position, I felt responsible to assimilate them into Academia. It was a treat to serve the Russ College, a true symbiotic relationship.

          <h2 class="display-5 text-black">SamplingApp ~ OpenSource Personal Project</h2>
          <p class="display-6 text-black">I first created the <a href="https://github.com/JasonWherry/SamplingApp" target="_blank">SamplingApp</a> because I wanted play around with statistics and start my own interdisciplinary project. Additionally, my Grand Father is a statistician, although he wears many other hats too, and I wanted to bond with him over this as he came to me with the idea. 
          <br><br>
          The goal of random sampling is to show that the <b>average</b> performance of a group (randomly sampled) is an unbiased estimate of the average performance of the entire population. To demonstrate the effectiveness, histograms are plotted which show the variance between different sample sizes. When the size of the randomly sampled group grows, we observe an upward trend towards the average performance of the entire population. In other words, the variance of the averages' changes, depending on the size of the randomly sampled group.

              <b>Rock Climbing</b> ~ Check out this <a href="https://youtu.be/_BiX0esenhM" target="_blank">video</a> of me climbing in Chattanoogna, TN.
              <br><br>
              <b>Playing the Ukulele & Drum Set</b> ~ Jamming without thinking, <u>improvising</u>, is one of the most natural feelings for me. I started drumming in 3rd Grade, immediately feeling the connection between my limbs and the drum kit. Growing older and sticking with it, minus a few bumps in the road, provides me with a life-long hobby to express myself. This vehicle for emotion helps me synthesize the body and mind, as I am the sole driver.
              <br><br>
              Playing with others requires another level of awareness. A sixth sense, inaudible to many, but present in most who make music. What I mean is, musicians understand how ebb and flow work together, processing the elements of music. If we think about the ocean, the water displays this with its tides: the ebb is the water <b>retracting</b> from the shore, back into the ocean while the flow is the water <b>arriving</b> onto the shore. Two distinct phases that can be practiced, as it is learned through repetition.

              <b>Traveling for outdoor pursuits</b> ~ Whether it's a road trip or a weekend getaway, spending time with Mother Nature is so important!
